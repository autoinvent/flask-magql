## Version 1.1.0

Unreleased

-   Adjust the default context to support Flask-SQLAlchemy-Lite.
-   Don't register views on each call to `init_app`, which caused issues when
    testing applications that used the app factory pattern.
-   Add Conveyor UI pages at `/conveyor/`. This is an autogenerated UI for all
    the capabilities provided by Magql-SQLAlchemy.
-   Register the extension in `app.extensions["magql"]`.
